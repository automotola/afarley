As a young boy, inspired by his musically rich neighborhood and religious upbringing, Afarley joined the choir and later started writing his own Dancehall and Reggae lyrics at the age of 16.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-music-career-built-abroad\"><a href=\"#a-music-career-built-abroad\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>A Music Career Built Abroad</h2>\n<p>He first left St. Maarten to study abroad in Miami, where he joined the Hip Hop group – ‘Mercenaries,’ and had his first encounter with a recording studio. Upon his return to the island, Afarley participated in a local radio talent show broadcast, but decided to leave once more, this time for the Netherlands at the age of 24, to vigorously pursue a career in music.</p>\n<p>In Leeuwarden, he was quickly introduced to a producer, and joined the Rap/Hip Hop group – ‘Borderline.’ When the group disbanded, Afarley branched out as a solo artist and went to produce two studio singles – ‘Music’ and ‘Good King,’ in Rotterdam, as well as his first mixtape – ‘Dancehall inna Europe.’</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his experience living in the Netherlands proved to be very challenging. Afarley found it difficult to get a job, find a house, and come to grips with the Dutch language, mentality, and culture, but despite the hardships, he was able to persist.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"in-2015\"><a href=\"#in-2015\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>In 2015</h2>\n<p>Last year, he completed his second mixtape – ‘Sierious ‘Bout It,’ in collaboration with multi-platinum producer Mihai, and released the single ‘Hardwork’ on Dutch radio stations Brasa and FunX. Afarley also came in contact with Anthony Records, a Jamaican producer whose Riddim (Zagga I Wish) is featured on the single ‘Destination.’</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-2016\"><a href=\"#in-2016\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>In 2016</h2>\n<p>This year, Afarley returned to St. Maarten after 13 years abroad with another mixtape – ‘Dancehall Pharaoh,’ and is currently taking a more active role in sharing his wisdom to voice the sociopolitical struggles of his generation, and encourage others to take better actions in the spirit of positivity, regardless of the circumstance.</p>\n<!-- demo to show you that you can use \"assets\" folder -->\n","__filename":"bio.md","__url":"/bio/","__resourceUrl":"/bio/index.html","__dataUrl":"/bio/index.html.a981adfa1fb73bd1f1f88489117449b6.json"}
